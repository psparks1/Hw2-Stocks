This is based off of one main for loop.  It goes from 2,  the first instance in the data set, to a very large number.  I used such a long number knowing it would be larger than the number of points in the data set. and then built an if statement to stop the loop if it reached a blank cell.  The loop goes until two adjacent. cells in the ticker column are not equivalent.   At that point it it stores  i and uses the previously stored starting point to calculate total volume net. change and percent change.  Then it sets i+1 as. the starter and keeps going.  After it finishes this for all ticker symbols there is a new loop.  This one  checks if  the change in value is positive or negative and then colors the spell the corresponding color.
